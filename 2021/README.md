# Advent of Code 2021

Trying to learn Go, so I decided to use it for this year's [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems. Code is far from optimal.

This year was really fun even though there were some quite hard puzzles.
I must admit that I didn't solve every puzzle entirely by myself and sought help on the amazing [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/).

In the past 25 days I have learned a new programming language (Go) as well as some new interesting algorithms.

This is also the first year where I managed to complete every single puzzle and only two of them were not completed on their first day!

Merry Christmas and a happy new year!
